### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Kaktus, a 19 years old back-end developer passionate about programming since i'm 10 and for the last three years i mainly focused on learning back-end architecture & microservices design ! 

Since 2020 I started & passionate about the world of blockchain and Web3 that helped me a lotttt to improve my skills in architecture of applications.

I am also passionate about science, new technologies and entrepreneuship.

### What I am focusing on ðŸ‘€
I work mainly with the C# programming language with the following stack on the back-end side: ASP.Net Core, EF Core, GraphQL, REST, Azure, SQL Server, MongoDB and Redis

However I also use some front-end frameworks such as ReactJS and Angular which are great frameworks to prototype, create and deploy easily applications.
Since I started into the Web3 world, I also learned a lot around the blockchain technology and everything that comes around, such **how to program** on them with Solidity and Rust (still learning the last one though) and also **how to create** decentralized applications (which are way more difficult to conceptualize & create compared to a "simple" web2 app).

### What projects I've been/I'm part of ðŸŒŸ

Two and half years ago, i've been recruited to work on the rework & conception in microservices of an SEO application on Shopify. That's how I get started with some (a lot of) Architecture patterns such as microservices, communication between them with Brokers and some Application patterns such as SAGAs, Event-Sourcing and CQRS.
This project helped me a lot on my dev and architectural skills, and it is by meeting some of the needs of this application that i've created my C# libraries [LinqToGraphQL](https://github.com/Kakktuss/LinqToGraphQL), [LinqToShopify](https://github.com/Kakktuss/LinqToShopify), [HotBrokerBus](https://github.com/Kakktuss/HotBrokerBus) and [HotRedisPool](https://github.com/Kakktuss/HotRedisPool).

Since then I've been recruited one year ago in a Company in Paris, Cityscoot, where I played (and still play :D) the role of backend software engineer internship. During this year, I learned a lot about the microservices model at scale and it also helped me to improve further more my skills in this field.
